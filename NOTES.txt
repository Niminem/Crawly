We'll definitely want crawly to create a CLI-driven application.
It will be much easier to leverage a UI with this later.
So...
1. config file
2. interaction via terminal for starting, pausing, etc.

TODO: let's focus on config file first
- need initial list of arguments
- give ability to add user-defined arguments that can be referenced
- create load/parse/etc functions for interaction
